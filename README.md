# Rosbag Control RQT Plugin

RQT plugin to control the bagfile playback from the terminal in ROS2. Useful to play/pause/step-once if your version of rosbag2 does not support time control from the terminal (see relevant [issue](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/issues/55) and [PR](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/847)).

Inspired in [CARLA Control RQT Plugin](https://carla.readthedocs.io/projects/ros-bridge/en/latest/rqt_plugin/).
